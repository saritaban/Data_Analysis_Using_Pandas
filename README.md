# Weather Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth **data analysis** on a weather dataset using **Python and Pandas**. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and perform various operations to understand patterns in weather data.

---

## Objective
The analysis aims to answer the following questions:

1. Find all the unique 'Wind Speed' values in the dataset.
2. Count the number of times the 'Weather' is exactly 'Clear'.
3. Count the number of times the 'Wind Speed' was exactly 4 km/h.
4. Identify all null values in the dataset.
5. Rename the column 'Weather' to 'Weather Condition'.
6. Calculate the mean 'Visibility'.
7. Calculate the standard deviation of the 'Pressure' column.
8. Calculate the variance of 'Relative Humidity'.
9. Find all instances when 'Snow' was recorded.
10. Find all instances when 'Wind Speed' is above 24 and 'Visibility' is 25.
11. Compute the mean value of each column against each 'Weather Condition'.
12. Compute the minimum and maximum of each column against each 'Weather Condition'.
13. Show all records where 'Weather Condition' is 'Fog'.
14. Find all instances when 'Weather' is 'Clear' or 'Visibility' is above 40.
15. Find all instances when 'Weather' is 'Clear' and 'Relative Humidity' > 50, or 'Visibility' is above 40.
